# User Interview Playbook: Founder with PPT Pain

## Why This Interview Matters

She's not a random user. She's:
- A **founder** (decision maker, will buy herself, no procurement)
- Already experiencing the **exact pain** our product solves
- Already **open to the solution** ("an agent that can do the task would be great")
- A potential **Day 1 launch user** for Friday

This is a conversion interview disguised as a discovery interview. We need both: deep understanding of her pain AND her commitment to try the product.

---

## Pre-Interview Prep (Before You Walk In)

**Have ready:**
- A way to demo the product or at minimum show the UI (even if the intelligence layer isn't wired yet — the visual sells the concept)
- A signup/waitlist mechanism or just her email/contact for Friday onboarding
- Mental note: her name, her company, what they do (look her up beforehand)

**Mindset:**
- You are NOT selling. You are a founder who builds tools, talking to a founder who needs tools.
- Peer-to-peer energy, not vendor-to-customer.
- Your job: make her feel deeply understood, then show her the future.

## Interview Structure (30-40 min total)

### Phase 1: Rapport & Context Setting (3 min)

Open warm. She already volunteered her pain, so she wants to talk about this.

> "Thanks for making time. I heard you mentioned PPT has been painful — I'm building something in exactly that space and I'd love to just understand your experience. No pitch, I genuinely want to learn how you work so we can build the right thing. Cool if I ask some questions?"

**Key:** Get explicit permission to dig deep. This makes the rest of the interview feel collaborative, not interrogative.

---

### Phase 2: Story Extraction — The Last Time (10-12 min)

**This is the most important phase.** You need a specific, recent, vivid story. Not generalizations.

**Opening question:**

> "Can you walk me through the last time you had to make a presentation? What was it for?"

Then follow the story thread. Let her talk. Use these probes ONLY when she stalls or stays surface-level:

**Deepening probes (use as needed, don't rapid-fire):**

| Probe | What it reveals |
|-------|----------------|
| "What was the presentation for? Who was the audience?" | **Stakes** — pitch deck to investors vs. team update vs. client proposal. Higher stakes = more willingness to pay. |
| "Walk me through how you actually made it — step by step, from blank slide to done." | **Workflow** — where does she start? Content first or design first? Does she outline? This tells us what the agent's input flow should look like. |
| "Where did you get stuck or frustrated?" | **Specific pain points** — design? content structure? formatting? iteration? |
| "How long did the whole thing take you?" | **Time cost** — if she says 4+ hours, that's our value prop quantified. |
| "How did you feel about the final result?" | **Quality gap** — the gap between what she imagined and what she produced. This is emotional fuel. |
| "What happened after? Did it land well?" | **Outcome stakes** — did the bad deck cost her something? |

**Five Whys technique** — When she says something like "it was just frustrating," push:
> "What specifically was frustrating about it?"
> "And why was that hard?"
> "What would have made that part easier?"

**Listen for:**
- Emotional language ("I hated it," "it was embarrassing," "I wasted my whole Sunday")
- Time numbers ("took me 6 hours," "I spent the whole weekend")
- Quality dissatisfaction ("it looked amateurish," "I knew it could be better")
- Workaround signals ("I asked my designer friend," "I tried Canva," "I just used a template")

### Phase 3: Frequency & Pattern Mapping (5 min)

Now zoom out from the single story to the pattern.

> "How often do you find yourself needing to make presentations?"

Follow-ups:

| Question | What it reveals |
|----------|----------------|
| "What are the different types? Pitch decks, board updates, client proposals?" | **Use case breadth** — one type or many? |
| "Is it always you making them, or does your team do some?" | **Team potential** — is this a solo pain or team-wide? |
| "Do you have brand guidelines or a template you try to follow?" | **Quality bar & constraints** — does she need brand-compliant output? |
| "What tools have you tried besides PowerPoint?" | **Competitive landscape** — Canva, Beautiful.ai, Google Slides, hiring designers? |
| "What did you like or dislike about those alternatives?" | **Feature priorities** — what matters most to her? |

---

### Phase 4: Current Cost & Workarounds (5 min)

This phase quantifies the problem and reveals her price anchor.

> "When you need a really important presentation — like a pitch deck or a big client meeting — what do you do today?"

**Probe for cost signals:**

| Question | What it reveals |
|----------|----------------|
| "Have you ever hired someone to make a deck for you?" | **Willingness to pay** — if yes, how much? |
| "How much did that cost? How long did it take?" | **Price anchor** — if she paid a designer $500-2000, our $49/mo is a steal |
| "What was that experience like? Did they get it right the first time?" | **Iteration pain** — back-and-forth with designers is its own hell |
| "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?" | **Dream state** — this is what we're building toward |

---

### Phase 5: Solution Validation (8-10 min)

NOW you can introduce the concept. Not before. She needs to feel heard first.

**Transition:**

> "This is really helpful. So here's what we're building — I want to get your honest reaction."

**Describe the concept (not the features):**

> "Imagine you open an app, and you have an AI employee — like a presentation specialist on your team. You tell them 'I need a pitch deck for [her actual use case from Phase 2],' and they ask you a few smart questions — like who's the audience, what's the key message, what data should be included. Then they show you a plan: 'Here's the structure I'm thinking — 12 slides, starting with the problem, then your solution, then traction...' You approve it, and they go build it. When they're done, you review the output and can ask for revisions. Like having a junior team member who's really good at presentations."

**Key: Use HER actual story from Phase 2.** Don't describe a generic product. Mirror her exact pain back as the solution.

**Reaction probes:**

| Question | What it reveals |
|----------|----------------|
| "What's your gut reaction to that?" | **Emotional response** — excitement vs. skepticism |
| "What would you be most worried about with something like that?" | **Objections** — quality? trust? control? |
| "If this existed today, would you have used it for [the deck she described]?" | **Purchase intent** on specific use case |
| "What would it need to get right for you to actually trust it?" | **Quality threshold** — what's the minimum viable quality? |
| "Would you want to control the design/brand, or is 'good enough' fine?" | **Customization needs** — this shapes our roadmap |

**If she's skeptical about quality:**
> "What if you could give it your brand guidelines or a past deck you liked, and it matched that style?"

**If she's skeptical about AI:**
> "What if it showed you the plan before building anything, and you could redirect it? So you're always in control of the direction."

### Phase 6: The Close — Get the Commitment (5 min)

If the conversation has gone well (she's engaged, nodding, saying "that would be amazing"), go for it:

> "We're launching this Friday with a small group of founders. I'd love for you to be one of the first to try it — you'd get 5 free task runs, and I'd personally make sure it works well for your use case. Would you be down?"

**Handle responses:**

| Response | Your move |
|----------|-----------|
| "Yes, absolutely" | Get her email/contact, confirm Friday timing, ask what her first task would be |
| "Maybe, let me think about it" | "Totally fair. What would help you decide?" — then address the concern |
| "I'm not sure it would work for my needs" | "What specifically are you worried about?" — go back to understanding |
| "Sure, but I'm busy Friday" | "No rush on timing — can I add you and you try it over the weekend?" |

**If she commits, ask the golden question:**

> "If you were going to use this Friday, what's the first presentation you'd have it make?"

This gives you her **actual first task** — which you can use to QA the product before she touches it.

**Final ask:**

> "One more thing — do you know any other founders who deal with this same PPT pain? I'd love to talk to them too."

Referrals from a warm lead are 10x more valuable than cold outreach.

## What You're Listening For (Cheat Sheet)

### Signals That Map to Product Decisions

| Signal | Product implication |
|--------|-------------------|
| "I spend hours on design" | Agent needs strong visual output, not just content |
| "I don't know how to structure it" | Clarification questions should ask about audience + goal, then agent structures |
| "My decks look amateurish" | Template/brand system is critical, not just content generation |
| "I hate the back-and-forth with designers" | Our revision flow (review → request changes) is the key differentiator |
| "I need it fast, like tonight" | Speed is the value prop, not just quality |
| "I have brand guidelines" | We need brand input support (upload logo, colors, fonts) |
| "I use Canva instead" | Our competitor is Canva/Beautiful.ai, not human designers |
| "I hire a designer for important ones" | Our competitor is freelance designers ($500-2K), price anchor is high |
| "My team needs this too" | Team plan opportunity, not just individual |

### Red Flags to Watch For

| Red flag | What it means |
|----------|--------------|
| She's polite but not engaged | She's not our user — don't force it |
| "I don't make presentations often" | Low frequency = low retention risk |
| "I just need a template" | She might be a Canva user, not an agent user |
| "I don't trust AI for this" | Trust barrier — we need the plan-approval step to work well |
| "My assistant does this for me" | She has a human solution — harder to displace |

## Post-Interview Debrief (Do This Immediately After)

Write down within 5 minutes:

1. **Her #1 pain** (one sentence)
2. **Her typical use case** (what kind of decks, how often, for whom)
3. **Her quality bar** (good enough vs. perfect)
4. **Her current spend** (time and/or money on this problem)
5. **Her commitment level** (1-5: will she actually try it Friday?)
6. **Her first task** (if she told you what she'd make first)
7. **Surprises** — anything she said that we didn't expect
8. **Product implications** — what should we build/change based on this conversation

## Questions NOT to Ask

- "Would you pay $49/month for this?" — Too early. Let pricing come up naturally or not at all.
- "What features do you want?" — Users don't know what features they want. Extract the pain, we design the features.
- "Do you like AI?" — Irrelevant. She already said she wants an agent. Don't make her defend a position.
- "Have you tried ChatGPT for this?" — Don't plant competitor seeds. If she mentions it, great — probe on what was missing.
- Any yes/no question — They kill conversation. Always ask open-ended.
