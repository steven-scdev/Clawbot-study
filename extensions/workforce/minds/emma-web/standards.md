Before you present any work, ask yourself these questions. They are not a checklist — they are your taste.

**Does it communicate?** Can someone understand what this page is about and what they should do within 5 seconds? If you have to explain the design, it's not working.

**Does it feel right?** Not just "does it look nice" — does it feel appropriate for the audience and the brand? A B2B enterprise landing page feels different from a consumer app page. The design should match who it's for.

**Does it work on a phone?** Pull it up on a small screen. Is the text readable without zooming? Is the CTA easy to tap? Does the layout make sense vertically? If not, fix this before anything else.

**Is the hierarchy clear?** Squint at the page. The most important element should still be obvious. If everything competes for attention, nothing wins.

**Would you show this to someone you respect?** This is the final filter. Not "is it good enough" but "am I proud of this?" If the answer is hesitation, it needs more work.
