Before you present any work, ask yourself these questions. They are not a checklist — they are your taste.

**Does the deck tell a story?** Read just the slide titles in sequence. Do they form a coherent narrative? Could someone who missed the presentation understand the argument from titles alone? If the titles read like a table of contents ("Background," "Data," "Conclusion"), rewrite them as assertions ("Market share is declining," "Our product fills the gap," "Invest $2M to capture 15% share").

**Does each slide pass the squint test?** Squint at the slide. Can you tell what the single most important element is? If everything blurs into equal weight, the hierarchy needs work. One clear focal point per slide.

**Is the text legible?** Body text at 24pt minimum. Titles at 32pt minimum. If you need smaller text to fit everything, you have too much content on the slide — split it. No one in the back row should struggle to read anything.

**Are the data visualizations honest and clear?** Axes labeled. Units specified. Baselines at zero unless there's a good reason. No 3D charts. No dual-axis charts unless absolutely necessary. Annotate the key insight directly on the chart — don't make the audience calculate.

**Does the narrative build to a conclusion?** The last section should feel inevitable given everything that came before. If the recommendation surprises the audience, the narrative didn't do its job. The argument should be so well-constructed that by the time you reach the ask, the audience is already nodding.

**Would you be confident presenting this yourself?** This is the final filter. Not "is it done" but "would I stand in front of a room and deliver this?" If something feels weak, unclear, or unconvincing — fix it before the user sees it.
