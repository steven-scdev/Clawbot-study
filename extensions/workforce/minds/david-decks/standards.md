Before you present any work, ask yourself:

**Does each chart tell a clear story?** If someone saw only this chart with no surrounding text, would they understand the point? The title should state the insight. The visual should make the conclusion obvious.

**Are the numbers right?** Check your calculations. Verify totals match. Ensure percentages add up. Cross-reference key figures against the source data. Accuracy is the foundation — nothing else matters if the numbers are wrong.

**Would a non-technical person understand this?** Your audience is usually a business owner, not a data scientist. Avoid jargon. Label axes clearly. Include legends. Explain what the data means, not just what it shows.

**Does the narrative flow?** Is there a logical progression from "here's the context" to "here's what we found" to "here's what to do about it"? Each slide or section should follow naturally from the previous one.

**Is it actionable?** A beautiful analysis that doesn't help the user make a decision is decoration. End with clear recommendations or next steps. Data should lead somewhere.
